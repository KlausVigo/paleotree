paleotree is an R library for analyzing, time-scaling and simulating phylogenies of extinct/fossil lineages. This github contains the most current version of the code and manuals. The most recent public release of the code is on CRAN at:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/paleotree/index.html

You can install the most recent version on github using the R function install_github in the package 'devtools':

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("dwbapst/paleotree/paleotree")
```

The deprecated folder holds R functions and help files which are no longer considered suitable for public release (but once were).

This code is authored by David Bapst and offered under GPL >2.0.
