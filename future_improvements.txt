#Paleotree improvement:

#new version of simFossilTaxa that stops at precise numbers of taxa
	#not min/max

#add limited time window option to getSampProbDisc and getSampRateCont

#compare make_durationFreq methods relative to getSamp methods

#ensure invSurv is working as desired

#make function for finding indirect ancestors / descendants in taxa objects
	#might be useful for improving efficiency of taxa2phylo

#implement a "stratophenetic"-esque timescaling method (minimal evol history)

#make function for making Foote-ograms?

#different time-slicing methods
